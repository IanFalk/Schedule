# Schedule

This project was inspired when I was working in a retail job and creating the weekly schedule. I had complaints about how the scheduling program did some things,
and a lack of features. So, I set out to create my own scheduling app in hopes to fix these things. 

The app is made using Java Core, Spring Boot, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is my first front-end project and has given me the opportunity to learn all these
languages except Java. I test the project using a local MySQL database, and publish it using an Amazon RDS Database and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
